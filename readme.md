This project is a complex backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt etc. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have. this is a complete video hosting website similar to youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe and so many features.

Project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more. I have spent a lot of time in building this project.
